						<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
						<p>Why should you choose us?</p>
					</header>
					<p>Landomedia is a revolutionary social media marketing service that offers affordable and effective advertising plans for all types of businesses. We work to create new and innovative ways for advertisements, growing businesses across the world. Because we are teenagers, we fully understand social media, which makes us unique from all other marketing companies. Our generation is unique, as we grew up with social media, and we use this to our advantage. By using our social media skills, Landomedia is able to efficiently advertise for all types of businesses.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Currently, we offer three types of plans, marketing, management, and networking. Our marketing plan works to advertise to customers from all over the country through the use of social media accounts exceeding 100 thousand followers. Our management plan works to build up businessesâ€™ social media accounts by curating unique content and engaging directly with each company's follower base. This helps convert company's most loyal followers into their best consumers. Our networking plan uses the power of peer influence to advertise by having individual social media users post ads to their accounts. 9 out of 10 social media users are more likely to buy an item if their friends are broadcasting it, which is why we created a plan that markets specifically through peer influence. Overall, Landomedia uses the power of youth, influence, engagement, and connection to successfully attract consumers, making Landomedia unique, affordable, and proficient.
